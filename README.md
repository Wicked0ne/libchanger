#ONLY WORKS WITH ROOT and BUSYBOX

You can download the latest release [Here](https://github.com/modbrin/libchanger/releases)
#INSTALLATION:
1) Copy LC-Cache folder to your /sdcard


2) Run LIBCHANGER_v0.4.apk

#How this works:

#1'
Then you press "Install 60 fps mod"(or Install 120 fps mod) app asks for SU access, and installs modified lib from /sdcard/LC-Cache/mod.so (or mod120.so) to /system/...
#2'
Then you press "Restore to normal" app uses SU access, then it installs original lib from /sdcard/LC-Cache/orig.so to /system/...
#3'
You can use any mod lib instead of libmmcamera_imx179_60hz.so or libmmcamera_imx179_120hz.so, just copy your mod into LC-Cache folder. 

#Great thanks to Pkmx for L Camera
